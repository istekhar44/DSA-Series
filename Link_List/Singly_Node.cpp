//   Singly Linked List â€“ Theory
//   A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure in which elements, known as nodes, are connected sequentially using pointers. Each node contains two fields:
//   Data: The actual value or information stored in the node.
//   Next: A pointer to the next node in the sequence.
//   1.The first node is known as the head of the list.
//   2.The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.
