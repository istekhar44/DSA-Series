// ðŸ”· What is Inheritance in C++?
// Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (members and methods) from another class (parent/base class).
// It promotes code reusability, extensibility, and logical hierarchy between classes.
